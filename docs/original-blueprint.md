## Implementation Steps

Each step builds incrementally on the previous step, ensuring no orphaned code and maintaining a working extension throughout development.

---

## Step 1: Extension Foundation Setup

**Context**: Create the basic extension structure with TypeScript configuration, package.json manifest, and activation lifecycle. This establishes the foundation that all subsequent steps will build upon.

**Expected Outcome**: A minimal VS Code extension that activates successfully and registers in the command palette.

```
Create a VS Code extension project with the following requirements:

1. Initialize a new TypeScript VS Code extension project structure:
   - package.json with extension manifest
   - Extension ID: "webhook-toolkit"
   - Display Name: "Webhook Toolkit"
   - Target VS Code version: ^1.102.0
   - Categories: ["Other"]
   - Main entry point: "./out/extension.js"

2. Set up TypeScript configuration:
   - Target ES2020
   - Include proper VS Code types
   - Output directory: "./out"
   - Source directory: "./src"

3. Create the main extension.ts file with:
   - activate() function that logs "Webhook Extension activated"
   - deactivate() function that logs "Webhook Extension deactivated"
   - Proper VS Code extension context typing

4. Add essential npm dependencies:
   - express: ^5.1.0
   - uuid: ^11.1.0

5. Add development dependencies:
   - @types/express: ^5.0.3
   - @types/node: ^24.1.0
   - @types/uuid: ^9.0.0
   - @types/vscode: ^1.102.0
   - typescript: ^5.8.3

6. Include proper build scripts in package.json for TypeScript compilation

7. Create a simple test command registration in package.json contributions:
   - Command ID: "webhookTool.test"
   - Title: "Test Webhook Extension"

8. Wire the test command in extension.ts to show an information message "Webhook Extension is working!"

Ensure all files compile without errors and the extension can be run in the Extension Development Host.
```

---

## Step 2: Configuration System

**Context**: Add VS Code settings integration to allow users to configure the extension behavior. This creates the configuration foundation needed for server settings in subsequent steps.

**Expected Outcome**: A working configuration system that can be accessed through VS Code's settings UI.

```
Extend the webhook extension to include a comprehensive configuration system:

1. Add configuration schema to package.json under "contributes.configuration":
   - webhookTool.server.port (number, default: 3000, min: 1024, max: 65535)
   - webhookTool.server.autoFindPort (boolean, default: true)
   - webhookTool.server.responseCode (number, default: 201, min: 200, max: 299)
   - webhookTool.server.responseHeaders (object, default: {})
   - webhookTool.server.responseBody (string, default: "")
   - webhookTool.storage.maxRequests (number, default: 100, min: 1, max: 10000)

2. Create a new file src/config.ts with:
   - Interface WebhookConfig defining all configuration options
   - Function getConfiguration(): WebhookConfig that reads from VS Code workspace settings
   - Function getConfigValue<T>(key: string): T helper for individual settings
   - Proper TypeScript typing for all configuration values

3. Update extension.ts to:
   - Import and use the configuration system
   - Add a new command "webhookTool.showConfig" that displays current configuration
   - Register the showConfig command in package.json contributions
   - Wire the command to show configuration values in an information message

4. Add configuration change detection:
   - Listen for workspace configuration changes
   - Log when configuration changes occur
   - Prepare foundation for restarting services when config changes

5. Include proper JSDoc documentation for all configuration interfaces and functions

Ensure the configuration can be modified in VS Code settings UI and changes are reflected immediately.
```

---

## Step 3: Basic HTTP Server Implementation

**Context**: Create the core webhook server functionality using Express.js. This server will be the foundation for receiving webhook requests in later steps.

**Expected Outcome**: A configurable HTTP server that can start/stop and accept POST/PUT requests.

```
Implement the core webhook HTTP server with proper lifecycle management:

1. Create src/webhookServer.ts with:
   - Interface WebhookServer defining start(), stop(), isRunning(), getPort() methods
   - Class WebhookServerImpl implementing the interface
   - Express.js server setup accepting only POST and PUT methods
   - All other methods return 404 with message "Method not allowed"
   - Server binding to localhost only (127.0.0.1)

2. Server functionality:
   - start(port: number, autoFindPort: boolean): Promise<number> method
   - If autoFindPort is true and port is busy, try ports sequentially (port+1, port+2, etc.)
   - Return the actual port used
   - stop(): Promise<void> method for graceful shutdown
   - isRunning(): boolean status check
   - getPort(): number | null to get current listening port

3. Basic request handling:
   - Accept POST and PUT requests to any path
   - For now, just log "Request received: [METHOD] [PATH]" to console
   - Return configurable response code, headers, and body from configuration
   - Add request body parsing middleware (express.json(), express.raw(), express.text())
   - Limit request body size to 10MB

4. Error handling:
   - Catch and log port binding errors
   - Handle server startup/shutdown errors gracefully
   - Emit proper error messages for debugging

5. Update extension.ts to:
   - Create WebhookServer instance in activate()
   - Add commands "webhookTool.startServer" and "webhookTool.stopServer"
   - Register these commands in package.json contributions
   - Wire commands to start/stop the server using configuration values
   - Show success/error messages for server operations
   - Ensure server stops cleanly in deactivate()

6. Integration:
   - Use configuration system from Step 2 to get server settings
   - Show informational messages with actual port when server starts
   - Handle configuration changes by restarting server if needed

Test that the server starts on the configured port and responds to POST/PUT requests with curl.
```

## Step 4: Request Data Models and Storage Schema

**Context**: Define the data structures for storing webhook requests and create the storage interface. This establishes the data foundation needed before implementing actual request capture.

**Expected Outcome**: Complete data models and storage interface ready for request persistence.

```
Create the data models and storage infrastructure for webhook requests:

1. Create src/types.ts with:
   - Interface RequestRecord defining:
     * id: string (UUID)
     * timestamp: Date
     * ip: string
     * method: 'POST' | 'PUT'
     * path: string
     * headers: Record<string, string>
     * body: string
     * contentType?: string
     * bodySize: number
   - Interface StorageMetadata defining:
     * version: string
     * lastCleanup: Date
     * totalRequestsReceived: number
   - Interface StorageSchema defining:
     * metadata: StorageMetadata
     * requests: RequestRecord[]

2. Create src/requestStorage.ts with:
   - Interface RequestStorage defining:
     * saveRequest(request: RequestRecord): Promise<void>
     * getRequests(): Promise<RequestRecord[]>
     * getRequest(id: string): Promise<RequestRecord | undefined>
     * deleteRequest(id: string): Promise<void>
     * clearAll(): Promise<void>
     * cleanup(): Promise<void>
   - Class FileRequestStorage implementing the interface
   - Use VS Code's workspace storage URI for file location
   - JSON file format for persistence
   - Proper error handling for file operations

3. Storage implementation details:
   - File path: {workspace.storageUri}/webhook-requests.json
   - Atomic writes using temporary files and rename operations
   - JSON serialization with proper Date handling
   - Create storage directory if it doesn't exist
   - Handle corrupted files gracefully with backup/recovery

4. FIFO cleanup logic:
   - cleanup() method removes oldest requests when over maxRequests limit
   - Preserve storage metadata during cleanup
   - Update lastCleanup timestamp

5. Create src/requestFactory.ts with:
   - Function createRequestRecord(req: express.Request, ip: string): RequestRecord
   - Generate UUID for each request
   - Extract headers, body, content-type, and other metadata
   - Handle different body types (JSON, text, raw)
   - Calculate body size for storage tracking

6. Update extension.ts to:
   - Initialize RequestStorage in activate()
   - Add command "webhookTool.clearStorage" for testing
   - Register command in package.json contributions
   - Wire command to call clearAll() and show confirmation

7. Add basic validation:
   - Validate request record structure
   - Ensure required fields are present
   - Handle edge cases like empty bodies or missing headers

Create unit tests to verify data model serialization and storage operations work correctly.
```

---

## Step 5: Request Capture and Storage Integration

**Context**: Connect the HTTP server to the storage system to actually capture and persist webhook requests. This brings together the server and storage components built in previous steps.

**Expected Outcome**: A working webhook server that captures and stores all incoming requests.

```
Integrate request capture with the storage system to persist webhook data:

1. Update src/webhookServer.ts to:
   - Accept RequestStorage instance in constructor
   - Add request capture middleware before response handling
   - Extract client IP address from request (req.ip or req.connection.remoteAddress)
   - Create RequestRecord using requestFactory for each incoming request
   - Save request to storage asynchronously (don't block response)
   - Log any storage errors without failing the request

2. Enhance request processing:
   - Capture all request headers as key-value pairs
   - Store raw body as string regardless of content type
   - Handle empty bodies gracefully
   - Detect and store content-type from headers
   - Calculate accurate body size in bytes

3. Add request validation and sanitization:
   - Limit request body size (10MB default)
   - Sanitize headers to prevent storage issues
   - Handle malformed requests gracefully
   - Log malformed requests without storing them

4. Error handling improvements:
   - Separate storage errors from request processing errors
   - Continue serving requests even if storage fails
   - Log storage failures for debugging
   - Ensure responses are always sent regardless of storage status

5. Update WebhookServer interface:
   - Add setStorage(storage: RequestStorage): void method
   - Allow storage to be injected after construction
   - Handle null storage gracefully (log warning but continue)

6. Modify extension.ts to:
   - Create RequestStorage instance in activate()
   - Inject storage into WebhookServer after creation
   - Add command "webhookTool.getRequestCount" to show stored request count
   - Register command in package.json contributions
   - Wire command to call getRequests().length and display count

7. Add automatic cleanup:
   - Trigger storage cleanup after each request save
   - Run cleanup asynchronously to avoid blocking
   - Log cleanup operations for debugging

8. Request response handling:
   - Use configuration values for response code, headers, and body
   - Set appropriate Content-Type for response body
   - Handle response header conflicts gracefully

Test the complete flow: start server, send various POST/PUT requests with different content types, verify requests are stored, check cleanup when limit exceeded.
```

---

## Step 6: Status Bar Integration

**Context**: Add a status bar item to show server status and provide easy start/stop functionality. This creates the first user-facing UI element.

**Expected Outcome**: A clickable status bar item that shows server state and toggles the server.

```

1. Create src/statusBar.ts with:
   - Class WebhookStatusBar managing the status bar item
   - Constructor accepting VS Code extension context
   - Methods: updateStatus(), show(), hide(), dispose()
   - Status bar item configuration:
     * ID: "webhookTool.serverStatus"
     * Alignment: StatusBarAlignment.Left
     * Priority: 100
     * Command: "webhookTool.toggleServer"

2. Status display logic:
   - When server stopped: "🔗 Webhook: Stopped"
   - When server running: "🔗 Webhook: Running :PORT"
   - Use appropriate colors: stopped (no color), running (StatusBarItemColor.Warning)
   - Tooltip: "Click to start/stop webhook server (Current: STATUS)"

3. Add toggle functionality:
   - Implement "webhookTool.toggleServer" command
   - If server running, stop it
   - If server stopped, start it with configured settings
   - Update status bar immediately after state changes

4. Error handling for toggle operations:
   - Handle server start failures (port in use, etc.)
   - Handle server stop failures gracefully
   - Show error notifications for failures
   - Ensure status bar reflects actual server state

5. Update extension.ts to:
   - Create WebhookStatusBar instance in activate()
   - Pass extension context to status bar
   - Register toggleServer command in package.json contributions
   - Wire existing start/stop commands to update status bar
   - Ensure status bar is disposed in deactivate()

6. Status bar lifecycle management:
   - Show status bar item immediately on extension activation
   - Update status when configuration changes
   - Handle VS Code window focus/blur events
   - Persist status across extension reloads

7. Integration with existing server management:
   - Connect status bar updates to all server state changes
   - Ensure status is accurate after manual start/stop commands
   - Update status when server crashes or fails unexpectedly

8. Add status bar click feedback:
   - Show brief progress indication when clicked
   - Provide immediate feedback even if operation takes time
   - Handle rapid clicking gracefully (debounce if needed)

Test that status bar accurately reflects server state, clicking toggles the server, and all scenarios update the display correctly.
```
