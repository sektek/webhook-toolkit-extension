# Webhook Log View Panel Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of the webhook request log view panel that appears in VS Code's main bottom panel area (alongside Terminal, Debug Console, etc.).

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Panel Configuration (package.json)
- ✅ Added `webhookTool.panel` view container in the "panel" location
- ✅ Added `webhookTool.logView` view under the panel container
- ✅ Added context variable `webhookTool.hasRequests` to control panel visibility
- ✅ Added commands for log panel interaction:
  - `webhookTool.openLogPanel` - Opens the log panel
  - `webhookTool.openRequestDetails` - Opens request details in new document
  - `webhookTool.deleteRequest` - Deletes a request from storage
- ✅ Added context menu contributions for right-click actions
- ✅ Added keyboard shortcuts (Enter for details, Delete for remove)

### 2. Log View Provider (src/log-view-provider.ts)
- ✅ Implements `vscode.TreeDataProvider<RequestRecord>` interface
- ✅ Provides methods: `getTreeItem()`, `getChildren()`, `refresh()`
- ✅ Integrates with existing `RequestStorage` for data retrieval
- ✅ Event emitter for tree data changes
- ✅ Request formatting: `[TIMESTAMP] [METHOD] [PATH] ([IP])`
- ✅ Timestamp format: "MM/dd HH:mm:ss"
- ✅ Different icons for POST (mail) vs PUT (pencil) requests
- ✅ Informative tooltips with request metadata
- ✅ Error handling for storage failures

### 3. Extension Integration (src/extension.ts)
- ✅ Register log view provider with VS Code
- ✅ Command implementations for opening details and deleting requests
- ✅ Context variable management (`webhookTool.hasRequests`)
- ✅ Real-time updates via periodic refresh (5-second intervals)
- ✅ Integration with existing server lifecycle and storage events

### 4. Request Management
- ✅ Tree view displays requests sorted by timestamp (newest first)
- ✅ Context menu with "Open Details" and "Delete Request" options
- ✅ Request details displayed in new JSON document
- ✅ Delete functionality with confirmation dialog
- ✅ Empty state handling (panel only shows when requests exist)

### 5. Data Display Format
- ✅ Label: `[01/01 12:45:00] [POST] /webhook/stripe (203.0.113.15)`
- ✅ Tooltip includes: Method, Path, IP, Timestamp, Body Size, Content-Type, Header count
- ✅ Context value: "requestItem" for command targeting
- ✅ Unique request IDs for reliable identification

### 6. Testing
- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests for log view provider logic
- ✅ Tests for storage integration, sorting, and formatting
- ✅ Error handling tests
- ✅ All existing tests continue to pass

## File Structure
```

├── log-view-provider.ts      # Main tree data provider implementation
├── log-view-provider.spec.ts # Unit tests for log view provider
├── extension.ts              # Updated with log view registration and commands
└── (existing files)          # Other extension files remain unchanged

```

## Usage Instructions

### For VS Code Users:
1. Install and activate the Webhook Toolkit extension
2. Start the webhook server using the command palette or sidebar
3. Send webhook requests to the server
4. The "Webhook Tool" panel will appear in the bottom panel area
5. View requests in the tree list, right-click for context menu options
6. Use Enter to open request details, Delete to remove requests

### For Extension Testing:
1. Run `node create-test-data.js` to create sample requests
2. Run `node demo-log-view.js` to see data formatting
3. Package and install the extension in VS Code for full testing

## Configuration
The log view panel is controlled by the context variable `webhookTool.hasRequests`:
- Panel appears when there are stored webhook requests
- Panel is hidden when no requests exist
- Updates automatically as requests are added or removed

## Technical Notes
- Panel location: "panel" (bottom area) NOT "explorer" or "activitybar"
- Tree view provider pattern for scalable request display
- Periodic refresh mechanism for real-time updates
- Integration with existing storage and server lifecycle
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality
